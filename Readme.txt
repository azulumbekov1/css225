Coding/Naming Conventions* File Names: All Python file names are lowercase with underscores (chapter1.py, player.py).* Function Names: Use snake_case for function names (e.g., chapter_one(), game_intro()).* Class Names: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., Player).* Variable Names: Use snake_case for variable names (e.g., player_name, inventory_list).* Documentation: Each module, function, and class should have a clear docstring that explains its purpose and parameters. Every chapter should include a brief description of its purpose.6. How to Run/Build/Deploy the ProgramTo run the game:1. Clone the repository:BashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/your-repo/dmitry-bivol-adventure-game.gitcd dmitry-bivol-adventure-game2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can check your version with:bashCopy codepython3 --version3. Run the game by executing the main.py file:bashCopy codepython3 main.pyThe game will prompt the user for their name and start the adventure.To modify the game:1. Open any chapter file (e.g., chapter1.py, chapter2.py) to edit or add new functionality.2. Use Git to commit your changes:bashCopy codegit add .git commit -m "Added new feature"git push7. An Overview of the ArchitectureThe Advanced Dmitry Bivol Adventure Game follows a modular architecture, consisting of:* Main Program: main.py serves as the entry point and orchestrates the flow of the game.* Player Class: player.py defines the player's attributes (e.g., health, stamina, skills) and actions (e.g., train, rest, fight).* Chapters: Each chapter (e.g., chapter1.py, chapter2.py, etc.) handles a part of the game’s story and allows the player to make decisions.* Game Flow: The game progresses based on player input, with each chapter dependent on the choices made in the previous chapters.* File Structure: Each chapter is a separate module, which can be imported into the main program.Game Flow Example:1. main.py ? Calls chapter1.chapter_one()2. chapter1.py ? Calls chapter2.chapter_two() based on the player's choice3. chapter2.py ? Calls chapter3.chapter_three() based on the player's progression4. This continues through Chapter 5, where the game's finale is determined.8. How to Start the Program (Start the Game)To start the game:1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.2. Navigate to the directory where the game is stored.3. Open a terminal window and execute:bashCopy codepython3 main.py4. The game will prompt the player to enter their name and start the adventure from Chapter 1.Additional Notes for Administrators:* Debugging: If the game encounters errors, ensure that Python 3.x is installed and check the terminal for specific error messages. Common issues may include missing dependencies or incorrect Python version.* Game Expansion: Future expansions can include more chapters, NPC interactions, side quests, or integration with external APIs for achievements or scoring.
